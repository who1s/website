In this workshop we cover the basics of reverse engineering, using the Ghidra toolset developed by the NSA. We will go through basic x86 assembly and how common programming constructs map to instructions, guided by small exercises involving Windows and Linux binaries.

 Requirements:  
- Some programming skills are required, C skills are a big plus.  
- Ghidra installed on Windows or Linux (virtual machines recommended for Mac users): <https://ghidra-sre.org/>

 Beverages, food and SAUNA will be provided to us by the sponsor <3

 Instructor: Matias Juntunen, Software Developer at Reaktor
