Secure Code Warrior Returns!!

 The event will be sponsored by Nordcloud :)

 Secure Code Warrior brings you a defensive security-based tournament from a developer's perspective.

 The tournament allows you to test your skill against the other participants in a series of vulnerable code challenges that ask you to identify a problem, locate insecure code, and fix a vulnerability. You don’t need extensive programming knowledge as this will be a great way to learn the foundations and intermediates of leveraging code that is not only functional but is also secure.

 You can find tournament step-by-step guide here: [<https://youtu.be/o8XhKK_eOOs](https://youtu.be/o8XhKK_eOOs>)

 The tournament is run virtually so you can join through your laptop. It should take only a few hours, drop-in as you see fit during the duration of the event to complete all the challenges and win prizes!
