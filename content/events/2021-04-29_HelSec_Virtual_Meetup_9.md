 Speaker bio:  
🔹 Jani Kenttälä makes cyber security easy. It hasn’t always been easy, but over 20 years as a security researcher and serial entrepreneur taught him to think differently. Jani wrapped up his experience from working with CERT teams and critical infrastructure providers and saw how especially small and medium sized companies need help. He founded Badrap to help them. Badrap is set out to make cyber security accessible for all. In the latest push Jani worked with 11 companies in a pilot called “Tonttu” to rapidly improve their security. The results and feedback were stellar. Now he brings good news, building security and trust can be easy.  
🔹 During days, Jani Räty is updating security policies and managing requirements, but during nights he is trying to catch scammers with honeytraps. The National Cyber Security Centre Finland (NCSC-FI) acknowledged his and his colleagues work for fraud prevention with Information Security Trendsetter 2020- award. He is also known in LinkedIn as the other founder of BlueTeamBuilders collective, bringing back the balance to the forc... security.  
🔹 Ilhan Gurel works for Ericsson in the CTO organization as an expert on trusted HW and SW technologies. His current role involves various security activities related to HW security, SW security, TEE (Trusted Execution Environment) technologies and practical use of cryptography.
