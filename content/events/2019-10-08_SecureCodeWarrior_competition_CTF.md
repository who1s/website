CONFIRMED!!!! This will be held on Tue Oct 8th!

 Are you a Secure Code Warrior?

 This competition will put your skills to the test. Players will be presented with a series of code challenges that will ask them to identify the problem, locate the insecure code, and fix the vulnerability. All challenges are based on real code examples, and are ranked from easy through to fiendishly hard! Each player can choose from a range of software languages to compete fairly in the Tournament. HelSec will reward the winner.
